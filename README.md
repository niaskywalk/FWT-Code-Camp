Some projects in the htmlauthor file are missing videos because they are too large. They are on Nia's home or available on the internet if anyone is reviewing this information. The multidigit code in each file is unique to a free download service and should be searchable. The names have otherwise been altered.

Note that user niaskywalk regularly works through low-paced, beginner projects and programs in order to better understand each project to determine if they are usable for teaching her tutorees and other mentees as they come up. These should never be thought of as niaskywalk's best work.
