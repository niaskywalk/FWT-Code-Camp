        <h2>A poem by AE Houseman</h2>
        <p>With Rue My Heart is Laden<br />
For golden friends I had,<br />
For many a rose-lipt maiden<br />
And many a lightfoot lad.<br />
By brooks too broad for leaping<br />
The lightfoot boys are laid;<br />
The rose-lipt girls are sleeping<br />
In fields where roses fade.</p>
