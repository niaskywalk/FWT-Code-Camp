        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Givins' Irish Castle is found in the friendly neighborhood of Beverly Hills in Chicago, IL. <em>The Castle</em>, as we called it, and I believe residents of the area still call it this, was built in 1887 by the successful real estate developer Robert C. Givins. He wanted something reminiscent of Dublin, so he sketched out his idea and quarried limestone bricks from nearby Joliet. This is the real history, however the legend told by children in the neighborhood was a lot more fun.</p>
        <h2>Legend</h2>
        <p>As children, we were told interesting stories about The Castle. One of my favorites was the story that the developer brought the castle stone by stone from Ireland! In conjunction with this, there is said to be a ghost living there. Sometimes they claim it came from Ireland with the castle. Some claim the usual, someone died there. Let's start a new rumor. The ghost came from a quarryman who died while extracting the stones for The Castle</p>

        <h1>Beverly Unitarian Church</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>At some point, a local fellowship joined the Unitarian Church and bought the castle. It has been a Church since 1942.</p>
        <h2>Fundraising</h2>
        <p>It is difficult and expensive to upkeep an historical landmark, which this building is classified as, so several members of the church came together to create a documentary about <a href="http://chicagosonlycastle.org/" target = "_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Chicago's Only Castle</a>. This history of this place is fascinating, and they wish to propigate the information and raise some landkeeping funds.</p>
